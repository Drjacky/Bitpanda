Think of the given model "Contact".
Imagine having any number of contacts with 'data': "A", "B" and "C" so your list last used contact-list might look like this: [A, A, B, A]
Implement the given function "getRecentContacts" in the ContactsComponent that returns a list with the following conditions:
    1. unique field "data" (NOT id)
    2. max length has to be three (if the list has size two and duplicate entries, then the returned list mustn't hold both: for ["A", "A"] the list should return ["A"])
    3. sorted by "last_used" (most recent first, last recent last -> fifo)
